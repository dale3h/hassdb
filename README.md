## Contribution Guidelines

Feel free to put up a pull request to fix a bug or maybe add a feature. I will
give it a code review and make sure that it does not break backwards
compatibility. If I or any other collaborators agree that it is in line with
the vision of the project, we will work with you to get the code into
a mergeable state and merge it into the master branch.
